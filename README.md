**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.**  You  _are_  allowed to use Internet documentation. If you  _do_  use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources),  **please cite your sources in the README**.

## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/-DRAFT-Coding-Challenge-S22#submission-procedure)Submission Procedure

Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1.  Create a  **public**  fork of this repo and name it  `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge-S22`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.

2.  Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using  `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).

3.  Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.

4.  Submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://acmutd.typeform.com/to/uTpjeA8G).

## Assessment Criteria 

Submissions will be evaluated holistically and based on a combination of effort, validity of approach, analysis, adherence to the prompt, use of outside resources (encouraged), promptness of your submission, and other factors. Your approach and explanation (detailed below) is the most weighted criteria, and partial solutions are accepted.

[Binary classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) is a type of classification task that labels elements of a set (i.e. dataset) into two different groups. An example of this type of classification would be identifying if people had a specific disease or not based on certain health characteristics. The dataset found in `mushrooms.csv` holds data (22 different characteristics, specifically) about different types of mushrooms, including a mushroom's cap shape, cap surface texture, cap color, bruising, odor, and more. Remember to split the data into test and training sets (you can choose your own percent split). Information about the meaning of the letters under each column can be found within the file `attributelegend.txt`.

**With the file `mushrooms.csv`, use an algorithm of your choice to classify whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.**

**You may use any programming language you feel most comfortable. We recommend Python because it is the easiest to implement. You're allowed to use any library or API you want to implement this, just document which ones you used in this README file.** Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file. However, we highly recommend giving the challenge a try, you just might learn something new!


## Answer:
I classified whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible by using the support vector machine algorithm. This is a supervised machine learning algorithm in which we feed the data to model and learns from it. So we have lots of properties of mushrooms provided and if it is poisonous or edible which is the label. After we give the data to the model it plots it in a graph and tries to find a hyperplane which seprates poisonous or edible data.

First I cloned forked the coding challenge to my perosnal repository and cloned it to my machine.
Second I used jupyter notebooks and imported all the nessecary packages like numpy,pandas,sklearn.
Thirdly I did some data preprocesing where I mapped the data to numeric values and standardize the data.
Fourthly I split the data into training and testing set where I put 80% training and 20% test and used training data to train model and testing data to test the accuary of the model.
Fifth after splitting gave the data to support vector machine classifier model.
Sixth Now if we give some new data to the SVM model it can predict whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible.
